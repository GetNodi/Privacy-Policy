# **Privacy Policy for Nodi**

**Last updated:** January 2026

Nodi (“Nodi”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through this Privacy Policy. This policy explains how the Nodi Chrome extension (“the Extension”) collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use it.

---

## **1. Information We Collect**

### **Authentication Information**

When you sign in using Google, Nodi uses Google OAuth via Chrome’s `identity` API to authenticate you. We receive:

* Your Google account email address
* Basic profile information (such as name)
* Authorization tokens required to access permitted services

Nodi **does not** receive or store your Google password.

---

### **Calendar Data**

If you grant permission, Nodi accesses Google Calendar event data **only** to:

* Read meeting details
* Identify attendees
* Provide meeting preparation insights

Calendar data is **not stored permanently** unless required to provide the core functionality of the Extension.

---

### **Third-Party Service Data (e.g., Salesforce)**

If you connect third-party services such as Salesforce, Nodi may access limited data necessary to:

* Identify meeting participants
* Surface relevant contextual insights

Nodi does not modify third-party data and only accesses data explicitly authorized by you.

---

### **Local Storage**

Nodi uses Chrome’s `storage` APIs to store:

* Authentication tokens
* User session data
* Configuration preferences

This data is stored locally in your browser or securely via Nodi’s backend services and is not accessible to other extensions.

---

## **2. How We Use Information**

We use collected information solely to:

* Authenticate users
* Provide meeting preparation insights
* Improve extension functionality
* Maintain secure user sessions

We **do not** use your data for advertising, tracking, or analytics unrelated to the Extension’s core purpose.

---

## **3. Data Sharing**

Nodi does **not** sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties except:

* When required to provide functionality you explicitly enable
* When required by law or legal process

---

## **4. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:

* Secure OAuth authentication flows
* Encrypted network communication
* Token-based authentication

However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

---

## **5. Data Retention**

* Authentication data is retained only while your account is active
* You may sign out at any time, which clears stored authentication data
* Data is deleted or anonymized when no longer needed for functionality

---

## **6. Your Choices and Controls**

You can:

* Revoke permissions at any time through your Google Account or Chrome settings
* Sign out of Nodi to clear stored authentication data
* Remove the Extension to delete all locally stored data

---

## **7. Chrome Extension Permissions**

Nodi requests only the permissions required to function, including:

* **identity** – to authenticate users via Google OAuth
* **tabs / activeTab** – to access contextual page information when you interact with the Extension
* **storage** – to securely store session and configuration data
* **system.display / side panel** – to present information within Chrome’s UI
* **host permissions** – to communicate with authorized APIs and services you connect

Nodi does not access browser data without user interaction.

---

## **8. Children’s Privacy**

Nodi is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## **9. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
